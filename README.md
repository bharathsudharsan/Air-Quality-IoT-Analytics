**[ipynb] Anomaly Detection using TRAFAIR Air Quality Dataset.ipynb**: We have run 12 unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms such as Angle-base Outlier Detection, Isolation Forest, clustering-Based Local Outlier, and other algorithms on the built TRAFAIR air quality dataset. The anomaly score of each model type is provided along with the T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (3D) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (2D) plots.
